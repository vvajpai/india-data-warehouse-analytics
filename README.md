# 🇮🇳 India Data Warehouse Analytics

An end-to-end **Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence** project built using **PostgreSQL** and **Tableau** to analyze India's **Power Generation**, **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, and **Railway Infrastructure** datasets.

This project demonstrates the complete analytics workflow—from raw CSV datasets to a Star Schema data warehouse and interactive Tableau dashboards.

# Data Warehouse Design

The PostgreSQL warehouse follows a **Star Schema** consisting of:

### Fact Tables

* fact_power
* fact_cpi
* fact_railway

### Dimension Tables

* dim_state
* dim_date
* dim_financial_year
* dim_power_sector
* dim_cpi_sector
* dim_cpi_commodity

The complete schema is available in:

```
docs/star_schema.pdf
